## Getting Started

To Download the application go to Releases and download the latest release (the installer.zip file). Then extract the zip and run the installer, this should create a file on your PC named "jtoh.dc.client" which you can access from the start menu.

## How does it work?

When you join a ring or zone the dropdown menu will be populated with tower and citadel names, just choose an option (the tower/citadel you will be doing) and press update tower.

## How do I know this is safe?

Well, you can see the source [here](https://github.com/Dollor-Lua/JToH-Discord-RPC-Client) Although you may not understand any of that code. Here is how the application works from a base: it uses your roblosecurity cookie to access api info such as what game you are in, this is so it can always see your game and not require you to have your settings as everyone can join. This may seem scary, and it does to me too, since everybody goes around saying "don't give others your roblosecurity". The file that uses this cookie is bloxauth.js, an open sourced roblox cookie authenticator for api access, and even other applications on the devforum use it. At the end of the day it is your choice though.
